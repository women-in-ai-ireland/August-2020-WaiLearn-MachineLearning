Project Type : This repo contains the project of the August ML wailearn group. It focuses on using ML to predict seismic bumps.

Blog Post : [Predicting Hazardous Seismic Bumps Part III: improving model performance for imbalanced datasets](https://medium.com/womeninai/predicting-hazardous-seismic-bumps-part-iii-improving-model-performance-for-imbalanced-datasets-88fa64b4d622)

Dataset Source : [seismic-bumps Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/seismic-bumps)

Dataset Desc : Mining activity was and is always connected with the occurrence of dangers which are commonly called
mining hazards. A special case of such threat is a seismic hazard which frequently occurs in many
underground mines

Credits : We are immensely grateful to Nabanita Roy for pointing out this very interesting dataset, her previous work formed the base for which we were able to build on, you can have a look at her work here [Part I](https://towardsdatascience.com/predicting-hazardous-seismic-bumps-using-supervised-classification-algorithms-part-i-2c5d21f379bc) and Part II!
