<p>We are immensely grateful to  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nabanita-roy/">Nabanita Roy</a> for pointing out this very interesting dataset,her previous work formed the base for which we were able to build on, you can have a look here (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nabanita-roy/">Part 1</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nabanita-roy/">Part 2</a>)!<br/>
 
Based on the data exploration and performance analysis carried out by Nabanita, the performance of the previous models were very low for the <b>recall metric</b> having just a 0.06 score for the best performing model SVM. This behaviour resulted in the conclusion that out of all the Actual Positive (hazardous) shifts, only 6% of the shifts have been predicted as Positive. Our focus was on improving this.

<a name="pre">__1. Premise__</a><br/>
Predicting Positive here is predicting <em>“ the possibility of hazardous situation occurrence, where an appropriate supervision service can reduce a risk of rockburst (e.g. by distressing shooting) or withdraw workers from the threatened area. Good prediction of increased seismic activity is therefore a matter of great practical importance. “</em><br/>

<b>We wouldn’t want to send miners into a mine with a substandard model!</b>

On the other hand, Precision for the best performing model is only 0.67, which means that out of all the shifts predicted as hazardous, (1 - 0.67) = 23% were actually low risk, which would mean a non insignificant number of shifts where miners may have been told to stay home, and thus a lower productivity.

Select the desired authentication method and follow the instructions.
Once you completed the set-up, you'll be asked to specify a 6-digit PIN, which will serve as an additional authentication method. 
Should the login fail despite the successful setup of the fingerprint or face recognition you'll be presented with <em>Figure 2</em>.
