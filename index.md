<p>We are immensely grateful to  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nabanita-roy/">Nabanita Roy</a> for pointing out this very interesting dataset,her previous work formed the base for which we were able to build on, you can have a look here (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nabanita-roy/">Part 1</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nabanita-roy/">Part 2</a>)!
the Data Exploration, Data Preparation and first models and performance analysis as Medium articles with a linked notebook!
The performance of those first models was very low for Recall: 0.06 the best performing model SVM with the raw dataset: this means that out of all the Actual Positive (hazardous) shifts, only 6% of the shifts have been predicted as Positive.

Select the desired authentication method and follow the instructions.
Once you completed the set-up, you'll be asked to specify a 6-digit PIN, which will serve as an additional authentication method. 
Should the login fail despite the successful setup of the fingerprint or face recognition you'll be presented with <em>Figure 2</em>.
